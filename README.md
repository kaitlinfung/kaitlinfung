Hi! We are two UMass Amherst Chemical Engineering students. 

We built a application that utilizes two open-source data sets from Kaggle. The first is a data set on chemical ingredients in cosmetic products. 
The second is a data set on hazards associated with chemical ingredients. We hosted both data sets within a database on Microsoft SQL Server. 
We built an application in Visual Studio with Python. Our application receives user input for a product name and it outputs a list of products with their chemical ingredients and associated hazard risks.
